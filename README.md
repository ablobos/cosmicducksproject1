# supreme-octo-system


## Description

This project allows users to search for a topic they'd like to learn more about, and see educational resources from Wikipedia and YouTube on one page.  We built this project to be a free resource for people who want to learn new skills. Through building it, we learned to use the CSS framework Bulma, and practiced our skills at pulling and manipulating data from third-party APIs.

You can follow the Wikipedia link to learn more about the topic you chose to explore.  You can then search other topics that interest you, and return to past searches by clicking the buttons below the search bar which capture your search history.
